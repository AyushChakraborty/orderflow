custom exception handlers throw the exceptions to spring, and global exception handlers returns
the response in a format defined by the dev.

when the controller methods return the Order object, spring passes it to jackson, which serialises
it to json and returns that to the end user. So the fields of the entity become the fields of the
json object

if ResponseEntity<T> object is returned from the controller methods, then the header, status can be
controlled, but

repositories should be thin, services like controller classes should contain the business logic

Mockito is used to create mock objects so that they can be tested in isolation
